# Berliner

An application for sharing your hobbies effectively.

## Installation
- Install berliner_backend prerequisites and follow backend installation process.  
- Install berliner_frontend prerequisites and follow frontend installation process.
- Run a backend binary file(make sure port 8080 is not used by other apps). 
- Run a frontend binary file(make sure port 5173 is not used by ohter apps).

Application should be running in port 5173 and you can access it by browser of your choice. You do not need to build a frontend and backend, running them will be enough for test purposes and building them will not give you results as there might be some problems because of the COR's without a server.
